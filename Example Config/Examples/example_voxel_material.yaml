# Example material yaml file
# A material file requires these tags:
# name - the name of this material (example: 'name: EpicGreenGrassMaterial')
# program - name of the program this material uses (example 'program: Default3DProgram')
#
# The actual meat of a material

name: example-voxel-material
program: example-voxel-program
textures:
  diffuse: atlas-global

# The children of the properties tag are iterated over
# The children are expected to be of the form:
# properties:
#   [property name]:
#     type: [int/float]
#     [x/r/u]: 0.0
#     [y/g/v]: 1.0
#     [z/b]:   0.7
#     [w/a]:   1.0
# ie:
# The name of the child is used as the name of the property,
# The child is scanned for the 'type' tag expected either 'int' or 'float'
# If the type is omitted, it is assumed as floating point
# And then the child is scanned for x/y/z/w or r/g/b/a, or u/v components containing their integral/floating point values
